Creating interfaces is a good practice in TypeScript to define the shape of objects or data structures. 
Interfaces provide type checking and help you catch errors during development. In your code, you can consider creating interfaces 
for objects or data structures that have a fixed structure and are used in multiple places. Here are a few scenarios where creating 
interfaces can be beneficial:

User Profile Data: If you have user profile data that has a consistent structure, you can create an interface to represent it. 
For example:

interface UserProfile {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  avatar: string;
  // Add other properties as needed
}


2. 
API Responses: If you are working with API responses that have a specific structure, defining interfaces for these responses 
can help ensure that you are correctly handling the data:

interface ApiResponse {
  data: any; // Define a more specific type for 'data'
  status: number;
  message: string;
  // Add other properties as needed
}


3.
Auth Credentials: If you have a consistent structure for authentication credentials, you can define an interface for them:

interface AuthCredentials {
  username: string;
  password: string;
  // Add other properties as needed
}



By defining these interfaces, you provide clear type annotations to your code, making it easier to understand and maintain. 
TypeScript will also help you catch type-related errors early in the development process.

However, you don't need to create interfaces for every object or data structure. Use them where they add value in terms of code 
clarity, maintainability, and type safety.
