Creating interfaces is a good practice in TypeScript as it helps provide type information and enforce the structure of objects in 
your code. In your case, creating interfaces can be beneficial for defining the shapes of different data types, especially when 
working with APIs or handling complex data structures.

For example, you might consider creating interfaces for:

User Data: If your application deals with user information, creating an interface for user data (e.g., name, email, avatar) can 
help maintain consistency and provide type safety.

Response Data: If you're making API calls and receiving data, having an interface to define the expected structure of the response 
can be very helpful.

Credential Response: If you have a specific format for credentials, creating an interface for it can clarify what's expected.

Other Data Types: Any other custom data types or entities in your application that have a specific structure.



Here's an example of how you might create interfaces:

interface UserData {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  avatar: string;
  // Add any other properties as needed
}

interface ResponseData {
  status: number;
  message: string;
  data: any; // Adjust this type to match the actual data structure
}

interface CredentialResponse {
  // Define the structure of your credential response
}

// Usage example:
const userData: UserData = {
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  avatar: "/images/john.jpg"
};

const responseData: ResponseData = {
  status: 200,
  message: "Success",
  data: { /* ... */ }
};



By creating interfaces, you provide clear definitions for the expected shapes of data, making your code more readable and easier to
 maintain. It also helps catch type-related errors during development.
